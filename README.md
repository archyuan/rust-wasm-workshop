# Rust WebAssembly Workshop

This is a workshop for learning about the usage and inner workings of Rust WebAssembly with a focus on the wasm-bindgen based toolchain.

## Suggested Prerequisites

This workshop assumes that you are familiar with Rust to an advanced beginner or intermediate level. If you are not, I suggest first taking a look at the [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

You should also have a passing familiarity with JavaScript and "modern" JavaScript workflows and toolchains.

## Getting Started

Make sure that you have the lastest version of [Rust installed](https://rustup.rs/) as well as [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/).

Once you have this, navigate to the `getting-started` folder.
